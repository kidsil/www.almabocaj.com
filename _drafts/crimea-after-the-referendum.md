<p>The last time that I wrote about the developments in Crimea I was referring the case under international law, since then Russia had deployed its troops in the region without a prior authorization from the Ukrainian authorities. Despite of the pressure from other western countries, Russia followed accurately its strategic steps and went on further in reaching the finish by taking over Crimea through a referendum.</p>
<p>On the 16th of March the Crimean people decided on a referendum for a seccession of the peninsula. The gradual and aggressive approach of Russia towards Crimea encountered people that were willing to be a part of Russia. The outcome of the elections resulted in 97% people deciding for a seccession of the peninsula, a very significant majority. The EU reaction over this fact resulted in sanctions</p>
