<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi there, I'm Alma Bocaj. This blog was a birthday gift from my beloved partner, Â who has observed my personal and academical development for a long time and was convinced that I had to start writing since I am a very passionate person for the things I do, to which I felt the obligation of doing some brainstorming and write down my thoughts and share some of my experiences with other people in the digital world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a major in law and political sciences and a specialization in european and international law I have gained some helpful skills that really spurred on my personal and professional development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this blog is still in a "newborn phase" I will be considering writing about various topics that I find interesting, with particular concern for human rights and rules of international law applied to the latest developments in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least I will share with you some recipes that fall under the vegan category :-) since I am vegan myself and love animals and very much care about our environment.</p>
