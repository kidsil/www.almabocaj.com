<p>These energy balls are very nutritious and delicious too. Preparation takes max. 30 minutes or even less.</p>
<p>For approx. 20-25 pieces you might need:</p>
<p>1. 550 g. dried dates<br />
2. 2 Tbs. tahini<br />
3. 1 cup nuts (I usually use walnuts or pecan nuts)</p>
<p>First you have to pit the dates. Afterwards you mix all the ingredients in the mixer so that you can obtain a thick paste. From the paste start making small balls with either a spoon or with your hands and roll them in coconut flakes. Thats about it. They taste better if you put them in the fridge before serving.</p>
<p>Bon appetit!</p>
